          <h3>About the kingdom </h3>
          <p>Colchis is located on the eastern shore of the Black Sea in what today makes up the western half of the country Georgia. People from this kingdom were known as Colchians. Much of the kingdom was built along the banks of the Phasis River (today the Rioni River). The mild climate of the Caucasus plus the extreme fertility of the region helped Colchis develop advanced agricultural techniques much earlier than the rest of Europe. From 1800 â€“ 1500 BC, Colchis was an urbanized center, reveling in Late Bronze Age advancements centuries before the Greeks. In particular, Colchians developed skillful metal working abilities. The bountiful harvest and skilled production of metal goods, combined with their seaside location, helped the Colchians become rich from trade.
